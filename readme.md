How do I approach designing software?

When I dive into designing software, I like to start with a good chat with everyone involved. Once I get a grip on what everyone needs, I break down the big picture into smaller, more manageable pieces. Think of it as taking apart a complex LEGO set and organizing the bricks by color and size.

Then comes my favorite part: sketching out ideas and planning my roadmap... so agile I guess. I remember working on a project where I filled my whiteboard with diagrams and flowcharts, and it looked like a scene from a detective movie! These sketches help me visualize the system architecture and data flow. After that, I build prototypes to bring these concepts to life, and we all gather around again (virtually, of course) to see what works and what doesn’t.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I got better at modular design, which makes everything easier to manage and update. And let’s not forget system architecture – I spent hours perfecting a scalable structure that could handle future growth.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

My design process usually starts with research and analysis. I dive deep into understanding the problem space and user needs. Then I brainstorm and sketch out initial ideas – my desk often looks like a scene from WW2.

Next, I create detailed wireframes and design documents for the 3D environment. One time, I even got feedback from my dog, Sage, who loves to sit on my keyboard while I work, making it quite the challenge! Then, I build interactive 3D prototypes to test out these ideas, adjusting textures, lighting, and geometry. After several rounds of testing and feedback, I refine the design and prepare it for the final development phase, ensuring all 3D models and animations are ready for implementation.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The tactics I’ve developed can definitely be applied to future projects. Iterative prototyping, for example, is a game-changer. Continuously improving the design through cycles of feedback and refinement ensures a better end product. The amount of window screenshots I have of the latest project is insane.

User testing is another key tactic – regularly involving users in the testing process helps ensure the design meets their needs. Creating reusable components through modular design and maintaining thorough documentation also set a strong foundation for future projects.

How do I approach developing programs?

When it comes to developing programs, I start with a solid plan. I outline the project scope, objectives, and timeline – it’s like planning a road trip. Then I move on to the design phase, creating detailed specifications.

Once I have the blueprint, I jump into implementation, writing and testing code based on the design specs. Testing is a crucial step – I remember a time when I discovered a bug just hours before I needed to submit a project. It was a stressful night, but the thorough testing saved the day. After testing, I prepare the application for release and deployment, followed by continuous maintenance to keep everything running smoothly of course, right?

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Working on my 3D scene project, I adopted several new development strategies. Agile development became my go-to approach, allowing for iterative cycles and constant refinement. Performance optimization was another key focus – I implemented techniques to ensure efficient rendering and smooth performance. I wanted this to run as if it was on an old PS2 system.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was a cornerstone of my development process. It allowed me to refine designs continuously, identify and fix bugs early, and enhance features incrementally. I recall a project where each iteration brought new insights and improvements, leading to a polished final product. User feedback played a significant role, ensuring that the end result met expectations.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

My approach to developing code has evolved significantly. Improved planning and time management have become second nature. I’ve learned to write cleaner, more maintainable code with proper documentation – a habit I picked up after having to revisit and decipher my own messy code from a previous project, well multiple previous projects. I am looking to improve my modulairty and scalability on every project I do in the future.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science can help me reach my goals of becoming a software developer for corporate Walmart by providing me with the essential skills and knowledge needed in the industry. Through my studies and projects, I’ve developed strong problem-solving abilities, which are crucial for tackling complex challenges in a corporate environment. learning various programming languages and software development methodologies has prepared me to create efficient, scalable solutions. By mastering computer science principles, I’m equipped to contribute to Walmart's innovative projects and drive technological advancements within the company. I have learned though that my favorite language to develop in would be C++, which is harder to get into with my lackluster experience level.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Computational graphics and visualizations have equipped me with new knowledge and skills that are invaluable for my future educational pathway. They’ve taught me how to create compelling visual representations of data, making complex information easier to understand. This skill is incredibly useful for presentations and research projects.

Computational graphics and visualizations has equipped me with new knowledge and skills that are invaluable for my future educational pathway. My computational graphics class played a significant role in this journey, teaching me how to create compelling visual representations of a virtual environment, making complex spatial information easier to understand and interact with. This skill is incredibly useful for 3D designing and also 2D, as it is used in video games and other simulators. Currently VR is even used at my walmart for active shooting training videos, so the technology and tools are implemented everywhere.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

In a professional context, these skills are equally beneficial. Being able to create stunning visualizations can set you apart in fields like data science, game development, and UI/UX design. These skills open doors and provide a competitive edge in the job market. For me, making 3D graphics would be a side job as the field has the best ROI for indie game makers or big companies that need to stream line a course material. Very difficult field to put all of your eggs into from the start.
